# Key Concept
Concern with not just understanding but also building intelligent entities^[Machines that can compute how to act effectively and safely in a wide variety of novel situation 能够计算如何在各种新情况下有效、安全地行动的机器].
  不仅要了解，还要建立智能实体

# Fun Fact
- Survey regularly rank AI as one of the most interesting and faster-growing fields. It is already generating over a trillion dollars a year in revenue.

- AI expert [[CH-005 Kai Fu Lee]] predict lecture frontier of AI are wide open. 

- Whereas student of an older science such as physics might feel the best ideas have already been discovered by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Marie Curie|Curie]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

# History
Historically, researchers have pursued several different of AI:
从历史上看，研究人员对人工智能有几种不同的追求：
- Intelligence in terms of **fidelity to human performance**. 
	与人类表现**忠实的智能**。
<br>
- Intelligence called **rationality**.  
	智慧被称为**理性**
<br>
- Intelligence to be a property of internal thought **processes and reasoning**. 
	智能是内部思维**过程和推理**的属性。
<br>
- Intelligence behaviour an **external characterization**. ^[Sometimes confussion between the terms "[[1 Introduction to Artificial intelligence (AI)]]" and "[[CS-003 Machine Learning (ML)]]" 有时，" 人工智能（AI）导论"和"机器学习（ML）这两个术语会引起混淆。] 。
	智力行为是一种**外部特征**

# 2 Dimensions of AI
1. Human vs rational 人类与理性
   Not suggesting that humans are "irrational" in the dictionary sense of "deprived of normal metal clarity". We are merely conceding that human decisions are not always mathematically perfect. 
   并不是说人类是 "非理性 "的，在字典里的意思是 "失去了正常的金属清晰度"。 我们只是承认，人类的决策在数学上并不总是完美无缺的
<br>
2. Thought vs behaviour 思想与行为
   A rationalist approach, the pursuit of human-like intelligence must be in part an **empirical science related to psychology**, involving observations and hypotheses about actual human behaviour and thought processes. 理性主义方法，追求类人智能在某种程度上必须是一门**与心理学**相关的实证科学，涉及对人类实际行为和整个过程的观察和假设。

Involves a **combination of mathematics** and **engineering and connects to statistics, control theory and economics**.
涉及**数学**和**工程学的结合，并与统计学、控制论和经济学**相联系。
