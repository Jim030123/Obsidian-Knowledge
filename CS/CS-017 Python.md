A python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.

An identifier starts with:

- A letter A to Z or a to Z or
- A underscore (\_) followed by 0 or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
- Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $ and % within identifiers.

-   Python is a case-sensitive programming language

-   Thus, manpower and Manpower are 2 different identifiers in Python.
