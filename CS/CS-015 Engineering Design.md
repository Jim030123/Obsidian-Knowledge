Design is an integral part of every engineering discipline.^[Airplanes, bridges, buildings, electronic devices, car]

>[!note] Definition
>A systematic, intelligent process in which designers generate, evaluate and specify designs for device, systems or processes whose forms and functions achieve clients' objectives and users' needs while satisfying a set of constraints.

Example:

| Type of Engineering    | Design Usage                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Civil Engineering      | Used to specify detailed plans for developing physical and naturally built environments.^[Bridge, road ,canal, dam and building.]                                                                 |
| Electrical Engineering | Used to capture, evaluate and specify the detailed qualitative and quantitative description of solutions. ^[Telecommunication system, electrical system and electronic devices.]                  |
| Mechanical Engineering | Used for analyzing, evaluating and specifying technical features required to construct machines and tools.^[Industry equipmrnt, heating and cooling systenm, aircraft, robot and medical devices] |

# Why do we conduct design in engineering disciplines?
Design is a lengthy and complex process requiring significant investments in time and effort.

There are many possible answers to this questions:
- Stemming from simple common sense to more complicated ones involving professional, ethical, social and legal implications.
- From common sense perspective, products of such complexity are hard to create, are costly to change and when built carelessly or incorrectly, can significantly impact human life.
- When working toward the creation of complex products, teams must organize in a disciplined manner and a systematic approach needs to be employed to carefully ensure that products are built to meet their specification.

>[!todo] Example of construction of a bridge that spans over a body of water
>- Required to support a particular weight
>- To maintain access to watercrafts navigating underneath, to withstand expected wind speed
>- To withstand expected wind speeds
>- Provide other features such as side-walks^[Being bound by a schedule and budget.]
>
>A bridge is a nontrivial task and requires years of experience, formal education and large teams collaborating together to achieve the construction goals.

>[!warning] Construction incorrectly
>- Reconstructing the bridge can skyrocket from its original construction cost.
>- If defects are undetected, the bridge could collapse, resulting in the catastrophic loss of human life. 
>- Airplanes, watercrafts, medical devices and safety-critical software systems, share comparable challenges and failure of these products can also result in catastrophic events.
  
In an engineering environment, before product construction begins, the design of products needs to be carefully and extensively planned, evaluated, verified and validated to ensure the product's success.^[Mainly achieved through design]
