# Key Concept
Software development approach based on values, principles and core practices.

The 4 values are:
- Communication
- Simplicity
- Feedback
- courage

The agile method called Scrum, which is named after a starting position in the sport of rugby.

Scrum's success has much to do with its extremely quick releases. A typical sprint cycle will last between 2 and 4 weeks. At the end of that period, the team is expected to produce a potentially releasable product.^[The applications or websites are constantly changing]

Activities and behaviours shape the way development team members and customers act during the development of an agile project.

2 Words that characterize a project done with an agile approach are:
- Interactive
- Incremental

# The 5 stages of the agile modelling development process

![[Pasted image 20250721125111.png]]
3 red arrows that loop back into the "Iteration" box and symbolize incremental changes created through repeated testing and feedback that eventually lead to a stable but evolving system.

Multiple looping arrows feed back into the productionizing phase. These symbolize that the pace of iterations is increased after a product is released.

The red arrow is shown leaving the maintenance stage and returning to the planning stage, illustrating a continuous feedback loop involving customers and the development team as they agree to alter to evolving system.

## Exploration
Explore environment, asserting conviction that the problem can and should be approached with agile development, assembled the team and assess team member skill.

This stage takes anywhere from a few weeks^[If already know team members and technology.] to a few month^[If everything is new.].

Will be actively examining potential technologies needed for a variety of tasks:
- Customer also are experimenting with writing user stories.
- Get the customer to refine a story enough so that can competently estimate the amount of time it will take to build the solution into the system are planning.
- Adopting a playful and curious attitude toward the work environment, its problems, technologies and people.
## Planning
Software analyst and customers agree on a date anywhere from 2 months to half a year from the current date to deliver solutions to their most pressing business problem.^[If exploration activiities were sufficient, this stage should be very short.]

Using the idea of planning game.
>[!info] Planning game [[Kent Beck]]
>The planning game spells out the rules that can help formulate the agile development team's relationship with their business customer. The strategy to pursue, the pieces to move and the player involved
>
>Rules: form an idea how you want each party to act during development, they are not meant as a replacement for a relationship.^[A basis for building and maintainning a relationship.]
>
>Goals: To maximize the value of the system produced by the agile team. To arrive at the value, have to deduct costs of development and the time, expense taken on so that development can go forward.
>
>Strategy^[Always one of limiting uncertainty (downplaying risk)]:  Design the simplest solution possible, bit the system into production as soon as possible, get feedback from the business customer about what's working and adapt their design from there.
>
>>[!info] Story Card
>>Become the pieces in the planning game that briefly describe the task, provide notes and provide an area for task tracking.
>
>Players: Development team and business customer. Deciding which business group in particular will be the business customer is not always easy because the agile process is an unusually demanding role for the customer to play. Customer decide what the development team should tackle first. Their decision will set priorities and check functionalities throughout the process.
## Iterations to First Release
These iteration^[Cycles of testimh, feedback and change] are about 3 weeks in duration.

Will be pushing to sketch out the entire architecture of the system, even though it is just in outline or skeletal form.

Goal: to run customer-written function tests at the end of each of iteration.

Should also question whether the schedule needs to be altered or whether you are tackling too many stories.
## Productionizing
The feedback cycle speeds up so that rather than receiving feedback for an iteration every 3 weeks, software revisions are being turned around in 1 week.

May institute daily briefings so everyone knows what everyone else is doing,

The product is released in this phase, but it may be improved by adding other feature.

## Maintenance
Once a system has been released, it needs to be kept running smoothly.

New features may be added, riskier customer suggestions may be considered and team members may be rotated on or off the team.

The attitude take at this point in development process is more conservative than at any other time.
