# Key Concept
Open-source Python library for data analysis.

It gives Python the ability to work with spreadsheet-like data for fast data loading, manipulating, aligning, merging.

Introduces 2 new data types to Python:
- Series
- DataFrame
  Represent entire spreadsheet or rectangular data, whereas the Series is a single column of the DataFrame


>[!question] Why should use Pandas?
>- It boils down to automation and reproducibility.
>- If there is a particular set of analyses that needs to be performed on multiple data sets, a programming language can automate the analysis on the data sets.
>- Not all spreadsheet programs are available on all operating systems.
>- Performing data tasks using a programming language forces the user to have a running record of all steps performed on the data.
