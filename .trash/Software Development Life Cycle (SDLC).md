# Key Concept
The SDLC is phrased approach to analysis and design based on assumption that systems are best developed through the use of specific cycle of analyst and user activities.

It has also been called the waterfall method because the system analysis completes the first phase, then moves down to the next, and so on, like water flowing steadily downward form one rock to another.

# 7 Phases of the SDLC

## Identifying problems, opportunities and objectives
   
An analyst is concerned with correctly identifying problems, opportunities and objectives.^[This stage is critical to the success of the rest of the project because no one wants to waste time addressing the wrong problem.]

The analyst look honestly at what is occurring in a business. Then, together with other organization members, the analyst pinpoints problems.

Opportunities are situations that the analyst believes can be improved through the use of computerized information systems. Seizing opportunities may allow the business to gain a competitive edge or set an industry standard.
机遇是指分析师认为可以通过使用计算机信息系统加以改进的情况。抓住机遇可以使企业获得竞争优势或制定行业标准。

**Identifying objectives** is also an important component of the first phase. The analyst will be able to **see whether some aspect of information systems applications** can **help the business reach** its objectives by **addressing specific problem or opportunities**. 
确定目标也是第一阶段的重要组成部分。分析人员将能够看到信息系统应用的某些方面是否能够通过解决具体问题或抓住具体机遇来帮助企业实现其目标。

The output of this phase is a feasibility report that consists a problem definition and summarizes the objectives.

Management must then make a decision on whether to proceed with the proposed project.
然后，管理层必须决定是否继续实施拟议项目。
   
People involves coordinating the project:
人员涉及项目协调：

- Users
- Analysts
- System managers

Activities in this phase consist of:

- Interviewing user management
- Summarizing the knowledge obtained
- Estimating the scope of the project
- Documenting the results

>[!warning] If the user group **does not have sufficient funds in its budget** or if it **wishes to tackle unrelated problems**, or it the problems **do not require a computer system**. 如果用户组**没有足够的预算资金**，或**希望解决无关的问题**，或问题**不需要计算机系统**。
>A **different solution may be recommended** and the **systems project does not proceed any further**.
>可能建议**不同的解决方案**，**系统项目不再继续**。

## Determining human information requirements

The analyst determines:
- The human needs of the user involved
- Using a variety of tools to understand how user interact in the work context with their current information systems.

Analyst uses:
1. Interactive methods:
   - Interviewing
   - Sampling
   - Investigating hard data
   - Using questionnaires
<br>
2. Unobtrusive methods:
   - Observing decision makers' behaviour and their office environments
   - All-encompassing method^[Prototyping]

Analyst will use these methods to pose and answer many questions concerning human-computer interaction (HCI):
- What are the users' physical strengths and limitations?
- What need to be done to make the system audible, legible and safe?
- How can the new system be designed to be easy to use, learn, and remember?
- How can the system be made pleasing or even fun to use?
- How can the system support a user's individual work tasks and make them more productive in many ways?

The analyst is striving to understand what information users need to perform their jobs. Analyst is examining:
- How to make the system useful to the people involved.
- How can the system better support individual tasks that need to be done?
- What new tasks are enabled by the new users were unable to do without it?
- How can the new system extend a user's capabilities beyond what the old system provided?
- How can the analyst create a system that is rewarding for worker to use?

People involved:
- Analysts
- User
- Operations manager
- Operations workers

Analyst analyst need to know the details of current system function of business under study: 
- Who: The people who are involved.
- What: The business activity.
- Where: The environment in which the who takes place.
- When: The timing.
- How: The current procedures are performed

Reasons for current operations is that. "It's always has been done that way", however, the analyst may wish to improve on the procedures.

After the analyst should understand how users accomplish their work when interacting with a computer and begin to know how to make useful and usable.

Analyst should also know how the business function and have complete information on:
- People
- Goals
- Data
- Procedures 
   
## Analysing system needs
Analyst undertakes involves analyzing system needs.

Tool and technique, data flow diagrams (DFDs) chart:
- Input
- Processes
- Output 

The business's functions and activity diagrams or sequence diagram show the sequence of events, illustrating systems in a structure diagrams show the sequence of events, illustrating systems is a structured, graphic forms.

From data flow, sequence or other diagrams, a data dictionary is developed that lists all the data items used in the system, as well as their specifications.

System analyst also analyses the structure decisions made.

Structured decisions are those for which the conditions, condition alternatives, actions and action rules can be determined.

3 major tools when are used when analyzing structured decision:
- Structured English
- Decision tables
- Decision Tree

Systems analyst prepares a systems proposal that summarizes what has been:
- Discovered the users, usability and usefulness of current systems
- Provides cost-benefit analyses of alternatives
- Makes recommendations on what^[if anything] should be done.

Manner:
- Which a recommendation or solution is formulated depends on the individual qualities.
- Professional training of each analyst.
- The analyst's interaction with users in the context of their work environment.

## Designing the recommended system
Analyst uses the information collected earlier to accomplish the logical design of the information system.

Analyst designs procedures for users to help them accurately enter data so that data going into the information system are correct.

Analyst provides for users to complete effective input to the information system by using techniques of good form and web page or screen design.

The user interface is designed with the help of users to make sure the system is:
- Audible
- Legible
- Safe

As well as attractive and enjoyable to use and enjoyable to use.

>[!todo] Example
>Physical user interfaces include:
>- Keyboard: To type in questions and answerss
>- Onscreen menus: To elicit user commands.
>- Variety of graphic user interfaces: use a mouse or touch screen.

## Developing and documenting software
Analyst works with coders to develop any original software that is needed.

Analyst works with users to develop effective documentation for software, including:
- Procedure manuals
- Online help
- Websites featuring frequently asked questions (FAQs)
- Read Me files shipped with new software

Users are involved from the beginning, documentation should address the questions they have raised and solved jointly with analyst.

[[Documentation]] tells user how to use software and what to do if software problem occur.

Coders have a key role in this phase:
- Design
- Code
- Remove syntactical errors from computer programs.

To ensure quality, a coder may conduct either a design or a code walkthrough, explaining complex portions of the software to a team of other coders.
## Testing and maintaining the system
Ciders alone complete some of the testing and some testing is done by systems analysts in conjunction with coders.

A series of tests to pinpoint problems is run, first with sample data and eventually with actual data from the current system.

Test plans often are created early in the SDLC and are refined as the project progresses.

Maintenance of the system and its documentation and carried out routinely throughout the life of the information system.

Coder routine work consists of maintenance and businesses spend a great deal of money on maintenance.

Maintenance of the system and its documentation, program updated can be done automatically via a vendor site on the web.
## Implementing and evaluating the system
### System Development
Analyst helps implement the information system.  Training users to handle the system.

Vendor do some training, but oversight of training is the responsibility of the system analyst.

Analyst needs to plan for a smooth conversation from the old system to the new one.

>[!note] Example
>- Process includes converting files from old formats to new ones
>- Building a database
>- Installing equipment
>- Bringing the new system into production
>

### Evaluation
A key criterion that must be satisfied is whether the intended users are indeed using the system.

Must be satisfied is whether the intended users are indeed using the system.^[It should be noted that systems wiork is often cyclical]

An analyst finishes one phase of systems development and proceeds to the next, discovery of problem may force the analyst to return to the previous phase and modify the work done there.

# The Impact of Maintenance

The system is installed, it must be maintenance.^[The computer applications must be modified and kept up to date.]

Estimates of the time spent by departments on maintenance have ranged from 48% to 60% of total time spent developing systems.

## 2 Reasons
1. Correct software errors
   
   No matter how thoroughly a system is tested, bugs or errors creep into computer applications.
   
   Bugs in commercial PC software are often documents as "known anomalies", they are corrected when new versions of the software are released or in an interim release.
   
   In custom software, bugs must be corrected as they are detected.

2. Performing system maintenance is to enhance the software's capabilities in response to changing organizational needs

3 Situations
1. Users often request additional features after they become familiar with the computer system and its capabilities.
2. The business changes over time.
3. Hardware and software are changing at an accelerated pace.

![[Pasted image 20250719004646.png]]
The illustrates the amount of resources^[Usually time and money] spent on systems development and maintenance.

The area under the curve represents the total dollar amount spent. Over time, the cost of maintenance is likely to exceed that of system development.

At a certain point it becomes more feasible to perform a new systems study because the cost of continued maintenance is clearly greater than the cost of creating an entirely new information system.

Maintenance is an ongoing process over the life cycle of an information system.

After the information system is installed, maintenance usually takes the form of correcting previously undetected software errors. Once these are corrected, the system approaches a steady state, providing dependable service to its users.

Maintenance during this period may consist of removing a few previously undetected bugs and updating the system with a few minor enhancement. 

As time goes on and the business and technology change, however, the maintenance effort increases dramatically.

# Using CASE Tools
Analysts who adopt the SDLC approach often benefit from productivity tools, created explicitly to improve their routine work through the use of automated support.
