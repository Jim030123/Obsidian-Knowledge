# Key Concept
Throughout the design process, designers are constantly engaging in problem-solving activities that are fundamental to all modern engineering projects.
在整个设计过程中，设计师不断参与解决问题的活动，这是所有现代工程项目的基础。

Broad sense:
- Engineers can be characterized as specialized problem solvers.
   工程师的特点是专门解决问题。
   
Their work requires them to:
  - Identify
  - Evaluate
  - Propose solutions to complex problem^[In particular domains] under tight project constrains.

In some situations, engineers tackle problems that have never been solved before, creating challenges to meet not only functional aspects of products but also their established schedule and budget.

Before engaging in more concrete design topic:
- A formal discussion on problem solving in necessary to identify fundamental concepts that are well understood by successful designers
- These serve as basis for establishing a holistic problem solving framework that can be employed any time during design.

To be a good designer, engineers must be good problem solvers.^[May require years of experience solving problems in a particular domain.]. Experience allows engineers to reuse already proven solutions across separate but similar problems.

In other cases, where unsolved problems are encountered, designers are required to "think out of the box" and carefully craft a systematic approach for solving the problem in an acceptable manner, which may require:
- Problem classification
- Identification of the solution approach
- Type of adequate solution
- Identifying the overall strategy foe reaching its solution.

Problem solving during design occurs in 3 different states^[Plotnik and Kouyoumdjian 2010]:
- Initial state
  Where problem is a problem itself.
  
- Operation state
  Where thinking about the problems occurs and viable solutions come to light.
  
- Goal state
  Where a final solution to the problem is found, marking the end of the problem-solving process. 
  
Designers employ several techniques and strategies to create a landscape suitable for problem solving. 

## Initial State
Design problems are not all the same; they vary in size, complexity and based on these characteristic, the amount of time and effort required for their solution.

It quickly becomes evident that certain problems are harder to solve than others. When determination is made, the strategy for the solution approach is adjusted to account for the additional complexity.

Being able to differentiate between types of problem is crucial in helping designers account for the amount of effort, time and risk associated with the solution approach.

### Problem Classification

| Problem      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Well-defined | Problem with clear goals and known constraints.<br><br>This makes scoping the problem, proposing a solution approach and arriving at the solution easier than with other types of problems.<br>                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ill-defined  | Problem with undefined or ambiguous goals and unknown constraints.<br><br>They are ambiguous with undefined goals and require more time and effort to clarify and interpret the problem to arrive at a solution.<br>                                                                                                                                              |
| Wicked       | Problem with no definite solution; not understood until after the formulation of its solution.<br><br>Can lead to contradictive goals that need additional resolution before the problem solving can occur. When contradictive goals are present, providing a solution to one part of the problem results in the inability of solving other parts of the problem. |

Evaluation of alternative designs may require advanced techniques to determine the best course of action, which tends to require more time.
## Operational State
It requires employing multiple techniques for problem solving such as:
- Using metaphors
- Decomposing problems into smaller, less complex problems^[Dicide and conquer]
- Reusing solution^[Pattern]

In all of the techniques, designer are expected to exhibit a "think outside the box" mentality to be able to solve complex problems. This requires shifting the mental model from a conventional approach to unconventional methodology where solutions to complex problems may arise from thinking in ways that deviate from conventional wisdom.

>The requirement for solving the 9 dot puzzle problem are as follows:

>1. Draw 4 straight lines to connect all dots.
>2. The pencil cannot be lifted from the paper once the line-drawing process begins.
>3. No lines can be retraced.

>This may seem difficult because of the tendency of fixing the mental process to operate on the assumption that lines should begin and end on a dot.
>
>Functional fixedness makes it awkward or even impossible to propose solutions that involve lines going past the dots, which is what is required to solve this problem.
>
>To increase the chance of overcoming functional fixedness, problems need to be attempted several times and considered from many different viewpoints and unusual angles.

### Thinking about the problem
When learning about a problem for the first time, problem solvers may begin by asking questions, which allows them to think about many different alternative solutions; as the problem-solving process moves forward, problem solvers can begin narrowing down the possibilities and think about the single best solution to the problem.

| Type                | Desctiption                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Convergent thinking | Type of thinking that seeks to fine one single solution to a problem. |
| Divergent thinking  | Type of thinking that seeks to find multiple solutions to a problem.  |

### Problem Solution
Problem solvers begin using divergent thinking with different level of abstraction and each level provides finer-grained solutions to the problem until convergent thinking can be employed to solve it.

Determining the type of solution required for a given problem can reduce wasted time and effort spent in attempting to find a single, optimal solution.

Designers can elect to seek approximate solutions as opposed to optimal that are solution that are appropriate and acceptable solution for meeting project constraints.

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for finding the correct solution to given problem. Algorithms do not normally involve subjective decisions or rely on intuition or creativity to find solution. Some types of problems, using algorithm to find solutions can be unrealistic^[Especially in time-driven, practical engineering problem.]

Heuristics provide a realistic approach for finding good approximation of the solution.

| Problem   | Description                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Algorithm | Fixed set of rules that lead to the solution of a problem             |
| Heuristic | Rules of thumb that may or may not lead to the solution of a problem. |
>[!quote] Heuristics [[Brassard and Bratley (1995)]]
>Heuristics can lead to optimal solutions; in others, they can lead to solutions that are far from optimal or no solution at all.
## Goal State
Represents the final state of problem solving. It is where adequate solutions to given problems are determined.
代表问题解决的最终状态。它是确定给定问题的适当解决方案的地方。

The concepts of initial, operational and goal state can be fused together to create a holistic problem-solving framework adequate to solving engineering problems at all stage of the development effort. The approach consists of the following tasks:
