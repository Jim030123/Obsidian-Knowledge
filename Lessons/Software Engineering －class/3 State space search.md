>[!note] Definition
>Fundamental AI technique for solving problems by exploring all possible states to find a solution.

# Key Components
## State
A specific configuration or situation in the problem domain. It is a snapshot of the problem at a particular point in time.
>[!todo] Specific location on a map
>New York City

## State Space
The set of all possible states that the problem can have. It includes the initial state, the goal state and all intermediate states
>[!todo] Specific location on a map
>All possible locations on the map, including cities, towns and intersections.

## Actions
Operations or moves that can be applied to a state to transition it to another state.
>[!todo] Specific location on a map
>Moving form one city to another such as driving form New York City.
## Initial State
The starting point of the problem from which the search begins.
>[!todo] Example
>Starting in New York City

## Goal State
The desired outcome or target configuration that the search aims to achieve.

## Search Algorithm
An algorithm that systematically explores the state space to find a path from the initial state to a goal state:
- Depth first search
- Breadth-first search
- A* search

## Application for Realistic Problems
- Route finding
- Travelling salesman problem
- VLSI
- Robot navigation
- Web searching
# Graph Theory Basic
- Problems are represented as graphs to navigate from an initial state to goal state
