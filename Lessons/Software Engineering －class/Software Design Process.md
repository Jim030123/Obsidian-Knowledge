The design phase incorporates many activities and tasks conducted by different teams and typically managed by personnel other than designers.

Requires a formal process to ensure that the design phase is conducted properly and that it addresses all the concerns identified throughout the software engineering life cycle.
# Software Architecture
>[!note] Definition
>Corresponds to a macro design approach for creating models that depict the quality and function of the software system.

Black box approach model used to evaluate the system's projected capabilities as well as its expected quality, all from multiple perspectives:
- That allows different stakeholders with different background and expertise, to evaluate the design and ensure the architecture is addressing their concerns.
- Capacity to evaluate high-level concerns from the stakeholders that deal mostly with non-functional requirement.

Serve as important communication, reasoning and analysis tools that support the development and growth of the systems.
# Detailed Design (verification and validation previous output)
>[!note] Definition
>The detailed step begins after the software **architecture is specified, reviewed and deemed sufficiently** complete for detailed design to begin.
>详细步骤在软件架构指定、审查并认为足够完整后开始，以便开始详细设计。

Build on the software architecture to provide:
- White box design element of the structure and behaviour of the software system
- Last major effort before construction to begins

Deals with refining the software architecture to reach a point where the software design is deemed sufficient for construction to begin.

Places a major focus on addressing the functional requirements of the system.

In object-oriented design:
- Components are refined into one or more classes
- Interfaces are realized
- Relationships between classes are specified,
- Class functions and variable names are created and design pattern are identified and applied.

## 2 major tasks of the detail design activity
### Interface design
Refer to the design activity that deals with the specification of interfaces between components of the design.

Can be focused on specifying the interfaces used internally within software components or externally across software components.
### Component design
During architecture, the software system is decomposed into logical components that abstract required system functions.

These logical components are refined and their interactions are modelled to verify the validity of their structural composition.

Requires a shift from the macro design approach to the micro design approach:
- To further decompose and refine system components into one or more fine-grained elements, functions.
- Data variables required for supporting the internal structure and behaviour of component.
