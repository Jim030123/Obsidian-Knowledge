>[!note] Definition of [[Software Design]]
>An indispensable phase of the [[Software Engineering Process|SEP]] for creating and evaluating software models that **guide the construction effort for developing high-quality software systems** on time and within the budget.
>软件工程过程的一个不可分割的阶段，用于创建和评估软件模型，**指导建设工作，**在预算范围内按时开发出高质量的软件系统。

Design is the process of **transforming functional and non-functional requirements into models** that describe the **technical solution before construction begins**.
设计是在施工开始前将**功能和非功能需求转化为描述技术解决方案的模型的过程**。

Concept of software design, its **activities and tasks must be well understood** so that a **problem-solving framework for designing quality into software products** can be established.
**必须充分理解**软件设计的概念、活动和任务，这样**才能为软件产品的质量设计建立一个解决问题的框架**。

Numerous design principles, processes strategies and other factor affecting how designers execute the software design phase:
影响设计人员如何执行软件设计阶段的设计原则、流程策略和其他因素不胜枚举：

- Understanding of the **designer's roles and responsibilities** can be acquired.
- Allowing **designers to become effective** in designing large-scale software systems under a wide variety of challenging conditions.
