- Making correct inferences is sometimes part of being a RA, because one way to act rationally is to deduce that a given action is best and then to act on that conclusion.
# 2 Advantages RA over the other approaches

# Goals of an Agent
- Agents have goals they want to reach, like surviving or making more robot.
- These goals are built into them, just like how some animals know to find food and shelter
