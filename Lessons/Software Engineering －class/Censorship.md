Publications compete with each other for access to information. Often this information is available only from government sources.

Publishers know that if they offend the government, their reporters may not be given access to as much information as reporters for rival publication, putting them at a competitive disadvantage.

Publishers have adopted ratings systems as a way of helping people decide if they^[their children] should access particular offerings.

>Voluntary rating systems help people decide if they will see a movie, watch a television show or listen to a CD.

>Other site have no such warning. People who stumble onto these sites are immediately confronted with images and text they may find offensive

# 5 characteristics of the internet make censorship more difficult
1. Unlike traditional one-to-many broadcast media, the internet supports many-to-many communications
It is relatively easy for a government to shut down a newspaper on a radio station, it is very difficult for a government to prevent an idea from being published on the internet, where millions of people have the ability to post Web pages.
\
	
2. The internet is dynamic
Millions of new computers are being connected to the internet each year.
\
	
3. The internet is huge
There is simply no way for a team of human censors to keep track of everything that is posted on the web. Automated tools are available, they are fallible. Hence any attempt to control access to material stored on the internet cannot be 100% effective.
\
	
4. The internet is global
National governments have limited authority to restrict activities happening outside their boarder.
\
	
5. It is hard to distinguish between children and adults on the Internet
How can an "adult" website verify the age of someone attempting to enter the site?
