>[!note] Definition
>The process of identifying, evaluating, validating and specifying the **architectural, detailed and construction**^[important input for development] models required to build software that meets its intended functional and non-functional requirements and the result of such process.

- High complex, difficult to create, costly to change and depending on the software product.^[Critical to human safety]
- Used to identify, evaluate and specify the structural and behavioural characteristics of software systems that adhere to some specifications.
- Provide blueprints that capture how software systems meet their required functions and how they are shaped to meet their intended quality.

# From different perspective
 1. Process perspective
	Software design is used to **identify the phase, activities, tasks and interrelationship** between them **required to model software's structure and behaviour** before construction begins.
	软件设计用于**确定阶段、活动、任务和它们之间的相互关系**，**是在开始构建之前对软件的结构和行为**建模所必需的。
	
2. Product perspective
	Software design is used to **identify the design artifacts** that result from the **identified phase, activities and tasks**. Therefore this product itself is referred to as software design.
	软件设计用于**确定由**确定的阶段、活动和任务产生的**设计工件。 因此，本产品本身被称为软件设计。

# Why it is important?
Form the foundation for all the software construction activities.
为所有软件构建活动奠定基础。

Allow software engineers **to create models that represent the structure** and **behaviour of the software system**.
允许软件工程师**创建代表软件系统结构和行为**的模型。

Through these models, the **main components and their interconnection for the solution are identified**.
通过这些模型，可以**确定解决方案的主要组成部分及其相互联系**。

Software designs are **reusable**, they can be **applied to different projects to provide ready made solutions to common problems**.
软件设计是**可重复使用**的，它们可以应用于不同的项目，为**常见问题提供现成的解决方案**。
