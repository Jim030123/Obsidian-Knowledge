To create the overall design elements appropriate for supporting the efficient refinement and construction of software systems. 

Emphasis on the system's quality and therefore provides the earliest means for ensuring that identified quality goals are evaluated and incorporated into the design before moving to more detailed design and construction work.

Design elements present systems from different perspectives, thus providing stakeholders with different backgrounds and expertise, this means **evaluating the appropriateness of architectural decisions for supporting the construction of the desired system**.

System Quality - Reliability, security and system performance must be preserved.

Architects work to create the overall design elements appropriate for supporting the **efficient refinement** and **construction** of software systems.

Architectural design must address quality properties^[performance, usability and maintainability] that combine together to produce software systems that meet the quality expected by their stakeholder.

# Key tasks in Architectural Design
## Identify [[Stakeholder|stakeholders]] concerns
A key factor in the architectural design architectural design activity is identifying and understanding the different ways stakeholders influence the system and how they interact with each other.

These concerns need to be elicited and captured before any design effort can begin.

An essential characteristics of the specification of concerns is their ability to provide verifiable specifications, which are used as evaluation criteria for all architectural design activities.

## Identify appropriate architectural views

Identify influences of architectural decision in organization

Evaluating and validating the architectural views used to evaluate the design from a particular stakeholders perspective.

Communication among stakeholders is enhanced during new or ongoing development or during a system's  design and determine the appropriateness of the design to meet their goals.

## Identifying architectural styles and patterns
Architectural styles and patterns provide an overall strategy for designing a family of software systems.

Provide generic, reusable architectural solutions, documented in a way that is easily understood and applied to new problems requiring similar architectural features.

Identifying architectural styes and patterns is one of the first decisions that software architects make.

## Identifying impact of architectural decisions in organisation
Impact on the budget and schedule^[Provides project management with more concrete representations of the effort required to build the software system]

Impact on customer base^[when faced with competing alternatives, each benefiting 1 customer more than others, architects to find ways to make decisions and minimize overall customer dissatisfaction]

## Evaluating and Validating the Architecture
Consider designing a large-scale, secure high performing, distributed system composed of multiple nodes, all while emphasizing the system testability and maintainability.

An unsuitable architecture us a recipe for disaster. Therefore, software architecture is recipe for disaster. Therefore, software architecture evaluation and validation are essential tasks of the software architecture activity.^[It is essential to evaluate and validate the suitability of the architecture]
