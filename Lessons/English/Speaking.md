Sleep Detection System

This system uses an infrared camera to monitor the driver's eyes and head movements. If it detects signs of drowsiness—like frequent blinking, slow eye movement, or the head nodding—it triggers a loud alert and gently vibrates the steering wheel. If the driver doesn’t respond, the system can safely slow down the car and suggest taking a rest. This helps prevent accidents caused by falling asleep while driving.
