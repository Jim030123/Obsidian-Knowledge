Hi my name is Jim. I'm a student from degree in software engineering. 

One common problem I've noticed that **People always lose their personal item in campus**. Incuded myself

That's why I create an application called SUC Find which create a channel can help student or lecturer find back their beonging.

This make my solution valuable for  everyone not need to nervous when the item accidently left behind in campus especially when semester break. For some situation, the application can efficiency aware people who want stolen something valueable item.

I'm currently looking for who want collaborate with me develop a application. So that, the application can be published quickly.
