Please be assured that all answers and identities of respondents will be kept in the strictest confidentiality.


# The Data Procedure after Questionnaire

Questionnaire -> Respondents' answer to your questions -> Data -> Managing Data -> Presenting data -> Describing data -> Data analysis 

## Managing Data
## Presenting Data
Organising the data collected and presenting it in a systematic form is known as "data presentation"

As a researcher, you must make a selection of what is worth presenting.

Data can be presented in the following formats:
- Tables
- Chart
- Graphs
- Infographic

## Describing Data
Data is sorted, organised and presented in the form of chart, tables, graph. In order to be analysed

>[!quote] Marshall and Rossman (1999)
>Data analysis is the "process of bringing order, structure and meaning to the mass of collected data".

### Steps
When describing data, consider answering the following questions

1. What is the title of the chart?
2. What do the heading tell you?
3. What significant information does the data provide?
4. Discussion. What can you conclude? What does the data imply

Describe trends - P1
Pizza consumption increased **gradually** from about 2 times in1975 to slightly above 80 times in 1995 then levelled out from 1995 to 2000.

The consumption of fish and chips was recorded at 100 times in 1975 and dropped to about 85 times in 1980. Apart from a brief rise again from 1980 to 1985, the consumption of fish and chips gradually declined over the 25 year timescale to finish at just under 40 times.

The consumption of hamburgers increased sharply throughout the 1970s and 1980s. There was a slight increase from 1985 to 1995 before it levelled out for 5 years.

Identify comparisons between categories - P2
In 1975, the most popular fast food among Australian teenagers was fish and chips; being eaten 100 times a year. This was far higher than pizza and hamburger, which were consumed approximately 5 times a year.

Pizza consumption increased gradually until it overtook the consumption of fish and chips in 1990.

The biggest rise was seen in hamburgers as the occasions they were eaten increased sharply thoroughly the 1970s and 1980s, exceeding that of fish and chips in 1985. It finished at the same level that fish and chips began with consumption at 100 times a year.

Provide reasons for comparisons - P3
