[00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=8) Now turn to section one. First you have some time to look at questions 1 to 7. Listen carefully and answer questions one to 
[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=48) seven. Um, I'm interested in doing some work for the library. Are you the person to speak to? Yes. Right. Well, um, what sort of work 
[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=59) are you interested in? I've just come to live here in Australia. I don't want a full-time job until my children have settled down, but I really need to get out of the house a 
[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=70) bit. And I heard you need voluntary workers for various projects. Right. But I don't know if I have the right skills. 
[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=78) Well, we do provide training. Oh, we always include an orientation to the library together with emergency procedures. That's fire regulations, emergency exits, first aid so you can 
[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=92) cope with accidents or sudden illness, things like that which are necessary for anyone who's working with the public. Then we give specialist training for particular projects like using our 
[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=104) database system. I do have quite good computer skills in fact. Oh, great. Is there any sort of uh dress requirement? Well, all staff have to wear a name badge, so they can be 
[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=116) identified if they go outside the staff only areas, but apart from that, there aren't many regulations. We ask you to sign in and sign out for insurance purposes, but that's all. How about 
[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=130) transport? Do you live locally? Well, not too far away. I'm at Porpus Beach. My husband needs a car during the day, but it's only about 20 minutes on the bus. In fact, we can reimburse part 
[02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=143) of your travel expenses in that case. Oh, would that be the same if I came by car? No. Uh because parking is such a problem here. One thing we are looking for 
[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=156) though is someone who can drive a mini bus. No problem. So, do the projects involve going outside the library? 
[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=164) Some, yes, but not all. We've just finished one which involved working with photographs taken of the area. 50 or 100 years ago. It basically involved what we call encapsulation. 
[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=177) Putting them in some sort of covers to keep them safe. Exactly. It's time consuming work and we were very grateful to have help with it. Then sometime next year, we're hoping to 
[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=189) begin working on an initiative involving the sorting and labeling of objects relating to local history. We'll be needing help with the cataloging. Well, I'd definitely be interested. 
[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=201) How about at present? Well, we have a small team who work to support those who are unable to read. Working with the blind, yes, or other groups who have reading 
[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=211) difficulties. We provide volunteers with equipment so that they can take books home with them and read them aloud onto CDs. We're gradually building up a collection that can be lent to those who 
[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=223) need them. H I can see it would be useful, but I'd really like to do some sort of work where I can get the chance to meet people. How about reading stories to children? That's done by our 
[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=235) regular staff. But we do have another project. It's a very longestablished scheme which involves helping those who are unable to have direct access to the library. Oh, I noticed someone with a 
[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=248) trolley of books when I was at the hospital last week. That sort of thing. That would have been one of ours. Yes, it's one of our most popular services. Lots of people who wouldn't dream of 
[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=259) going to the library normally or when they're at home borrow a book when the trolley comes around the ward. I can imagine. Yes, I'd definitely be interested in that. Right. So, how do I 
[04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=271) enroll? Well, we do ask all volunteers to commit themselves to a regular period each week. I could probably do five or 6 hours. Oh, 
[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=280) be careful not to take on too much, but we do need someone for a couple of afternoons from 2 to 4. So, 4 hours altogether. That sounds fine. Before you hear the rest of the 
[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=292) conversation, listen carefully and answer questions 8 to 10. Now listen and answer questions 8 to 10. Right. So here's the application form. It asks the usual questions, name and 
[05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=338) address and telephone number. You also need to fill in details of who we should get in touch with in case of any accident or problem like that. Uh, we do need to have that filled in. And there's 
[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=349) a space for date of birth, but that's only if you're over 75, so we won't worry about that. No. Oh, it asks for qualifications. 
[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=360) Do I need to provide certificates? They're not necessary. We'll need the names of two referees, not relatives or family members, obviously. Uh, what else? Signature of 
[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=373) parent or guardian? That won't be necessary as I assume you're over 18. Yes. What's this? It says civil conviction check. 
[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=383) That's a document we have to provide by law for those working on projects involving children. So, we won't need it in your case, but you will need to sign this separate document. That's a a copy 
[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=396) of commitment. It's basically an agreement to work according to the library guidelines. So, if you'd like to fill this all in, uh, you can do it here or take it home, 
[06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=406) whichever you prefer. I'll take it home if that's okay. Right. Well, thank you for your time. That is the end of part one. You now have half a minute to check your 
[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=418) answers. Now it turns to part two. Part two, you will hear the general manager of a golf club talking to some people who 
[07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=458) would like to become members. First, you will have time to look at questions 11 to 16. Now listen carefully and answer questions 11 to 16. 
[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=501) Now ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to this meeting. Demand for membership places has far exceeded our expectations this year. So it was decided to gather you all here together 
[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=515) to go through the process step by step once rather than many times with each of you individually. The first thing you need to do is not fill in the application form. This you 
[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=529) see is a waste of time unless you have found an application sponsor. Your sponsor must be an existing full member of the club. Now once you have your sponsor, you should log on to our 
[09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=544) website and fill in and send through the membership form. Uh you will be prompted to provide the relevant deposit at the same time as you submit your application. Uh you may do so using any 
[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=558) major debit or credit card. Uh the next step is for you to attend a general meeting of the club. There are typically meetings held once a month. After the club meeting, you will 
[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=571) then be required to wait a while in order for the club committee to examine and if all is in order, approve your application. It may be necessary to ask you to come forward for an additional 
[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=585) interview before approval is granted uh depending on the circumstances. Now, once you have been approved, you are almost a member of the club. All you need to do then is pay the remaining 
[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=599) balance of your membership fee. Having done this, you are officially a member of Blaine Golf Club. However, you cannot start to play in competitions until you have acquired your handicap. In order to 
[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=616) do this, you must send in three cards. The committee will then issue you with a club handicap within 7 days on the basis of how you performed in each of the three rounds you played. 
[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=633) Before you hear the rest of the discussion, you have some time to look at questions 17 to 20. Now listen and answer questions 17 to 20. Now I won't spend much more than a 
[11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=678) few minutes on this, but let's go through the different membership types quickly. Now remember all the information I'm about to give you and more is available on our website. The 
[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=692) first category is full ordinary member. Basically, this is a full membership that gives you full playing rights during competitions and for casual golf as well. It costs £10,000 to become a 
[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=709) full member or alternatively four installments of £2,500. Our next category is associate. This is for a golfer who is already a member of a club but wants to join ours too while 
[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=725) keeping his existing club as his main club. Uh you have the same rights as a full member but the cost is £9,000. I must remind you that there is a limited number of memberships of this 
[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=741) kind available. 5day members pay £5,000 to join. And this payment can be put towards becoming a full member at a later date if you would like to upgrade your membership 
[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=756) status. You enjoy full playing rights during casual play and can play in all weekday competitions. However, you cannot enter competitions at the weekend. 
[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=771) Intermediate membership is open to golfers under the age of 25 and costs £1,800 as do the other remaining membership types, junior, senior, and overseas. 
[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=788) If you are an intermediate member, you too have full playing rights for casual play. However, you can only play in competition if a full member of the club invites you to join him. 
[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=803) Junior members are aged between 12 and 18. They enjoy restricted playing rights in casual playing time and are only allowed to play on Monday and Wednesday mornings. They can occasionally play in 
[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=820) competitions, but the opportunities to play in this format are severely restricted. Senior members enjoy full rights at all times, and overseas members can play on the course casually 
[13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=834) at any time and can enter competitions if invited to do so by a full member of the club. Now, that is the end of part two. You now have half a minute to check your 
[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=848) answers. Now it turns to part three. Part three. You will hear two business studies students discussing a presentation they'll do on an article on working 
[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=889) effectively in groups. First, you have some time to look at questions 21 to 26. Now listen and answer questions 21 to 26. 
[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=932) So Brad, what did you think of the article on group work? Oh, hi Helen. Uh, yeah, it was pretty good with helpful pieces of advice on how to make group work effective. I 
[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=944) think we were lucky to be given such a straightforward text to present at the management skills seminar. Yeah, actually shall we discuss it now? Have you got time? 
[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=955) Sure. It's only a 10-minute presentation. So, we just need to explain and then give our views on the main points raised in the article. I'll jot down some notes. Right. 
[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=967) So, there are three main sections. I suggest we start with listening. Yeah. effective listening in groups because it's not something that's frequently covered on courses in our 
[16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=980) field. No. And we should say that in the presentation. Yeah. And also effective listening's pretty simple. You know, I don't think 
[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=988) it's hard to learn. Well, people think it's easy, but in my experience, most of us tend to be very lazy listeners. Okay, I wouldn't argue with that. 
[16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1000) Something I do think we should emphasize is the power of the listener's posture, gestures, etc. in making speakers feel respected. Not that you're just waiting for them to 
[16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1011) finish before jumping in with your own ideas. Uh-huh. Okay. Right. Uh, the next section is on goal setting. Let's make sure we're 
[16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1019) clear what the article says on this. Yeah. Well, firstly, it says that all group members must be given time to explain their own goals. That's it. Yeah. 
[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1029) And then did it say that the whole group should agree on common goals? That's a bit too strong. It's more that everyone's agendas should be equally acceptable. 
[17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1040) But it does say that goals have to be realistic, you know, achievable within a particular time. You've got it. That's really what the article's saying. There isn't really any 
[17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1051) point in having ideals if group members know they won't come to anything within a reasonable period. So, I think a summary covering those points will be enough for that part of 
[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1062) the presentation, don't you? Yeah. Now, the last section is about conflict resolution. Actually, I thought it was the worst part of the article. 
[17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1071) Me, too. I don't think it went into sufficient detail on the issue. Actually, I thought it devoted too much space to it, but that it was all rather 
[18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1080) boring. You know, it didn't mention some of the more radical theories. Absolutely. I found that really irritating. Right. And also I think it 
[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1089) could have said more about conflict sometimes being healthy in groups. Absolutely. It just mentioned rather glibly about how we should avoid thinking of winners and losers and that 
[18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1100) quick resolution of conflict is always desirable without explaining what these terms mean. Well, it gives quite detailed 
[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1108) definitions but doesn't develop a proper argument. Right. So for the presentation, I think we just give some definitions and 
[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1118) and then explain what we felt were the weaknesses in the article's treatment of conflict resolution. Yeah, good. Now you have some time to look at 
[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1128) questions 27 to 30. Now listen and answer questions 27 to 30. So let's think about what we have to prepare for the actual presentation. 
[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1170) Well, I suppose we'll use PowerPoint, but I'm hopeless at using it, especially if it has any visuals. I really have to look into doing a course on it because I know I'll need it in the future. 
[19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1183) Don't worry. I'm quite happy using PowerPoint and I'll put it together when everything else is ready. That's a relief. But yes, do that later. Okay. Now, I heard the tutor saying we 
[19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1193) have to include some well-chosen quotations from the article. I'm not sure if we do. I'll email him to find out. No need. I can just have a look at the 
[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1203) specs he gave us when he set the task. That'll be quicker. But the tutor definitely said we have to prepare a handout to go with the talk. I'm not really sure how we do that. 
[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1214) Sarah did one last year. Is she? She's doing the same option as me on marketing. I'll ask her advice on what to include. 
[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1221) Great. So, that just leaves the bibliography at the end. I suppose it'll mainly be articles. Yeah. So, we'll just look on the web and we can leave that to later. 
[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1232) But we've been advised against that. Well, we could have a look through some journals in the library. I think we should start by looking through module handbooks. I think 
[20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1241) that'll give us some good leads. Yeah, you're probably right. So, that's all the topics. That is the end of part three. You now have half a minute to check your 
[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1253) answers. Now it turns to part four. Part four. You are going to hear a talk about some British customs. First you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40. 
[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1327) Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40. Good morning. My name is Marca Smith, a counselor here at the student services section of the university. And this 
[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1341) morning, I'd like to talk to you about visiting a British home. This may help you to cope well with your study and social life in Britain. There is a commonly quoted saying in Britain, "An 
[22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1353) English man's home is his castle," which sums up the importance we give to our own bit of private territory. If you are living in a British home or are invited to visit or stay with someone, it is 
[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1365) important to act thoughtfully. For example, be punctual for meals. And if you know you have to miss one, let your host know as soon as possible. Check whether it is convenient for others in 
[22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1378) the house when you wish to take a bath or wash and dry laundry. And unless your host employs someone to do the housework, you are expected to make your own bed and keep your room clean and 
[23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1389) tidy yourself. If you don't have a door key, remember to make arrangements if you intend to be out late. and keep your hosts informed of your whereabouts so they don't worry. These suggestions 
[23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1401) apply whether you're a guest or a lodger and will help the household to run smoothly. If you're staying as a guest of a British family or even visiting for one 
[23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1411) meal, it is customary to take a small gift of flowers, chocolates, or something to drink. Don't spend too much as this could embarrass your hosts. If you're staying for several days as a 
[23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1423) guest, it is usual to give a small present when you leave. Usually, you will get onto firstname terms with people you meet quite naturally and quickly. If you're unsure, continue to 
[23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1434) use their family name, surname, and title until they ask you to use their first name. Older people and those with whom you have a more formal relationship may prefer to stick to surnames. For 
[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1448) example, Dr. Smith or Mrs. Smith. If you're going to eat with British people or to stay with a British family, you may want to know if there are things that they normally do or don't do at the 
[24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1460) table. Rather than worry too much about rules, you may like to watch other people and copy what they do. It also helps to understand a few customs first. Both at home and in restaurants, people 
[24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1474) normally wait until everyone has got their food before they start eating. However, they will start before this if someone says, "Please don't wait or don't let it get cold." 
[24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1485) When people have started, they keep their cutlery, knives, forks, and spoons on the plate when they are not using them and leave them on the plate when they finish the course. For each course, 
[24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1496) different cutlery is used. You may also notice that people don't usually spend much time at the table talking, drinking, and smoking. In fact, after dinner at home, it's fairly common for 
[25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcwEOnQLjCc&t=1510) everyone to leave the table together and have coffee in the living room. If you are staying with a family or visiting informally, it's usual to offer to help with household chores, for example,
