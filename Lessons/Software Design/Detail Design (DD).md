Box-box approach characteristic

Detailed left undefined and deferred to downstream designers are created to define the necessary details for fully specifying the internal structure and behaviour of components identified during architecture.

Fill the gaps in the provide a complete picture how the system achieves its functional requirements (software quality attribute) within the quality framework established by the software architecture.

Begin once the software architecture is specified, reviewed and approved by all the stakeholders in the project.

Logical components are refined and their **interactions are modeled** to verify the validity of their structural composition. ^[Reflect with the component and module (Compartmentlization)]

A shift from the macro design approach to the micro design approach to further decompose and refine system components into one or more fine- grained elements, functions and data variables required for supporting the internal structure and behaviour component.

>[!note] Definition by IEEE
>The process of refining and expanding the preliminary design phase of a system or component to the extent that the design is sufficiently complete to be implemented.

# Key Tasks


For these reasons, detailed design serves as the gatekeeper for ensuring that the system's specification and design are sufficiently complete before construction begins

# Process

[Detail Design]] -> Creating detailed design -> Evaluating detailed design -> Documenting detailed design -> Monitoring and controlling implementation
